# SQLAlchemy-Challenge10-KNovak

Hello,
Thank you for taking the time to review my SQLAlchemy Challenge 10 where we will look at an analysis of data collected from resources of .csv and sqlite.

My analysis can be found on my ipynb file labeled climate_starter_novak.ipynb.

I created an app that features the data collected from the climate_starter_novak.ipynb file andcan be found on the file labeled app.py. Please be sure to open the terminal of that code to open up the app. You can do so my typing in python app.py and clicking on the link http://127.0.0.1:5000 to view the app on a browser.

Please reach out should you have any questions.

Thank You,
- Kyle Novak
